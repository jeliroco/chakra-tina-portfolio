A few weeks ago, a Twitter trend called [HustleGPT](HustleGPT "https://mashable.com/article/gpt-4-hustlegpt-ai-blueprint-money-making-scheme") caught my eye. Basically, someone told ChatGPT to generate as much money as possible using no manual labor. The AI essentially became his boss, and he just did whatever the AI told him to do. The concept went viral and I'm fairly confident that fellow made a lot of money. But it raised an interesting question for me: how productive could I be as a developer, if I used AI to fulfill every other role in the development lifecycle/ecosystem?

I started with some core assumptions:

* I want to act purely as a developer.
* I want the core feature set of whatever I build to involve the OpenAI API in some way.
* I want to leverage AI for as many tasks as possible.

I started by asking ChatGPT for some ideas for ways to leverage the OpenAI API for some novel web application. I stated some of my interests -- music, theatre, video editing -- and told it to give me 10 ideas.
