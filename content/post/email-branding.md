I finally set myself with a Google Domain and deployed this app via Vercel. I was then consequently able to create a set of email addresses for my site. All of the emails filter back to my personal email where I am able to categorize them. But I was having trouble distinguishing them from each other in my Gmail. I thought it would be neat to use my funky [Wacom One Drawing Pad](first-daily-artboard "First Daily Artboard") to create some "branding icons" for each gmail account. Each one is a different colour so I can tell them apart at a glance. They are also included in the signature for each email.

<grid
  gridItems={[
    {
      _template: "image",
      url: "/uploads/jeliroco.png",
      caption: 'The "Admin" Icon'
    },
    { _template: "image", url: "/uploads/dev.png", caption: 'The "Dev" Icon' },
    { _template: "image", url: "/uploads/music.png", caption: 'The "Music" Icon' }
  ]}
  style={{
    gridTemplateColumns: { base: "repeat(1,1fr)", md: "repeat(3,1fr)", sm: "" }
  }}
/>

These are definitely very rough -- you can probably tell that I'm still not very adept with the drawing pad. But I still think they're kinda neat. So now if you reach out to me via these emails, you may see these icons in the response!
