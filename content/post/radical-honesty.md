Why lie when you could tell the truth?

Brad Blanton's Radical Honesty discusses the merits of telling only the truth⁠—not even white lies⁠—about the world around us. While very ethical in theory, the results of radical honesty can often be negative; there are times when a white lie can protect a person from an uncomfortable truth. We don't need to tell Grandma that her stuffing was better last year.

But what happens when we stop telling little white lies about ourselves?&#x20;

It goes without saying that a portfolio website is typically used to "put one's best foot forward", and aims to highlight the best parts about oneself and minimize the negatives. We want everything to be polished. I personally struggle with perfectionism, and therefore publishing any of my own work can be daunting. Once I have presented something to the world, there is no going back.

In an effort to push myself out of my comfort zone, I have made some intentional choices with this portfolio site that could be considered unorthodox.

Firstly, the only way for me to save a post is to publish it. The moment it is published, it appears in the post list. I will always allow myself to go back and edit posts, but I will not allow myself to delete them. I will refrain from "unringing that bell".

Secondly, I will not select a single subject for the site. I will allow myself to publish posts about any topic. The focus of the site is development, because that's my primary career path. But I will also feature posts from other domains⁠ (whether  I am an expert in that domain, or not).
