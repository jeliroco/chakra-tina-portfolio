Why lie when you could tell the truth?

Brad Blanton's Radical Honesty discusses the merits of telling only the truth⁠—not even white lies⁠—about the world around us. While very ethical in theory, the results of radical honesty can often be negative; there are times when a white lie can protect a person from an uncomfortable truth. We don't need to tell Grandma that her stuffing was better last year.

But what happens when we stop telling little white lies about ourselves?&#x20;

It goes without saying that a portfolio website is typically used to "put one's best foot forward", and aims to highlight the best parts about oneself and minimize the negatives. We want everything to be *"polished",* and *"clean"*. I personally struggle with perfectionism, and therefore publishing any of my own work can be daunting. Once I have presented something to the world, there is no going back. In an effort to push myself out of my comfort zone, I have made some intentional choices with this portfolio site that could be considered unorthodox.

Firstly, the only way for me to save a post is to publish it. The moment it is published, it appears in the post list. I will always allow myself to go back and edit posts, but I will not allow myself to delete them.

Secondly, I will allow myself to publish posts on any topic. The focus of the site should be software development because that's my primary career path, but I will also feature posts from other domains⁠. In my life I have also made a living in theatre, music, video production, and social media management⁠—these subjects are of equal importance to me as software, and they deserve a place on this site.

Thirdly, I will not limit myself to topics in which I am an expert. For example, I have always dabbled with visual art, but I have never been particularly good at it. However, in the words of Jake from Adventure Time, "sucking at something is the first step towards being sorta good at something". By letting myself share all the stuff I'm no good at, maybe I can push myself a little more to progress and improve.

I am hoping that these core tenets will provide me with great opportunity for personal growth. They will ideally help me move past perfectionism, towards a state of constant iteration towards success. For you, the reader, I hope these tenets provide you with a better understanding of who I am. When it comes to the topic of myself, there is no greater expert than me, and if you are going to take anything away from this portfolio, it may as well be the truth.

I like to think that if I were Grandma, I would want to know the truth about my stuffing.
