This is a promotional video that I produced in 2021 for [Upper Canada Playhouse ]()in Morrisburg, Ontario, Canada.&#x20;

This theatre means so much to me. I spent a lot of time backstage there, growing up as the child of an actor and a musician. I eventually worked there as a production intern in the summers during high school and undergrad. Then after graduation I was lucky enough to perform onstage there, in theatrical productions and concerts.

Unfortunately for all of us, the COVID-19 pandemic obliterated the live performance industry, and it is still struggling to recover even 3 years after the pandemic began. When Donnie Bowes, the artistic director of UCP, reached out to me in need of a promotional video for a fundraising campaign, I was happy to oblige.

So many people wanted to contribute to the video: directors, writers, actors, members of the community, politicians, the list goes on. Because the pandemic was raging, I was not able to travel to all of the participants to record them myself. So instead, I distributed a list of simple instructions for participants to record themselves:

* Film in landscape;
* Record someplace quiet;
* Film yourself just looking at the camera for 10 seconds, then smile softly and hold that position for 10 more seconds (this would give me access to some "B-roll" for editing);
* Say "Help the playhouse get on with the show!" (this would be used for the montage at the end), and then wait 10 more seconds;
* In your own words, talk about what UCP means to you (if I could do it all over again, I would have broken this down into more specific questions);
* Upload your footage to a Dropbox link for me to download.

Generally speaking, participants followed these instructions very well and provided me with a wealth of footage to edit. The editing process was fairly complex, but followed this set of general steps:

* Load all of the videos into my video editing program (which at the time was Davinci Resolve which has a free version);
* Put a "lower-third" label for each participant BEFORE cutting the footage into clips (so that I wouldn't have to label all of the individual clips);
* Cut each participant's footage into clips based on the general "topic" they are discussing;
* Group all the clips based by topic;
* Sort each topic into a cohesive story;
* Sort the list of topic stories into a cohesive "super-story".

Finally, I produced an instrumental track to play under the video footage. The instrumental track evolved throughout the video, until breaking into a down-tempo rendition of the jingle I had produced for UCP in years past. I think the music effectively induced a more emotional response from viewers, especially those who were familiar with the original jingle.&#x20;

Overall I would say that the video I created was very strong. I was able to successfully carve a narrative out of the unstructured footage provided by dozens of individual contributors. There were some lessons for me to carry to subsequent projects:

1. Give participants more instructions re: audio quality. A lot of the footage I received had a lot of ambient noise that I had to spend time reducing in editing.
2. Break the "comments" into a series of specific questions to answer. I had to spend a ton of time grouping footage by sentiment, when I could have just directed the participants with more granular questions. I wouldn't want to overdo it though, as the process I followed allowed them an opportunity to speak from the heart.
3. Seek more content for B-roll. Beyond what was sent to me by participants, I only had access to a small number of cast photos. I could have advocated for more B-roll footage, or even gone out to record it myself.
