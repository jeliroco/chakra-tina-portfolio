Our project team was just awarded the 2022 [Red Nucleus](https://rednucleus.com/ "Red Nucleus") Team Award! It is amazing to see a project that I helped to architect and develop come to life and delight a client. This project and this award are proof that my mission of improving our capabilities with pipeline automation, componentization/modularity, repeatable offerings, and Veeva functionality, is making an impact.
