So, I bought myself a Wacom One drawing pad yesterday for about $350. Couldn't help myself. Had a drawing pad before but it didn't have a screen on it, and I could never get used to not looking at what I was drawing on. Here's what it looks like:

I have resolved to spend a little bit of time with it every day to improve my visual arts skills. There was a time when I was pretty adept with Illustrator and Photoshop. It's about time I dusted off those skills.

Here is my first drawing board. Nothing much to look at. But I'll check back in every once in a while to show off my progress (if any).

Hint: there's a cool unintended side-effect of (a) the transparent image background and (b) the customizable theme on this site. Try messing around with the theme settings in the footer.
