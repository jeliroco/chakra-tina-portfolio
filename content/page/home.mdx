      ## Hi, I'm jeliroco..


      I'm a

      solutions-oriented software architect, designer, and developer with the
      ability

      to look beyond confines of the current project to optimize the future. I
      never

      want to solve the same problem twice, and my modular development
      philosophy

      reflects that.


      I'm also a

      creative tinkerer with a broad range of development experience in various

      domains. I view programming as an extension of my creative toolkit, and
      seek to

      create beauty through code.


      I'm an

      authentic communicator. I believe in plain speaking, diplomacy, and
      honesty,

      whether leading a client meeting or a cross-functional work session. I
      have

      found a niche in liasing between the technical vernacular of developers,
      the

      scientific language of content writers, and the business vocabulary of
      clients.


      My skillset

      extends far beyond the domain of software and into the realm of video and
      music

      production, theatre and film, and visual art. I love to integrate these
      skills

      into my work wherever I can find the opportunity.
