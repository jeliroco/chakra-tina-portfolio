      ## Hi, I'm Liam.


      I'm a

      solutions-oriented software architect, designer, and developer with the
      ability to look beyond the confines of an individual project to optimize
      for the future. I never want to solve the same problem twice, and my
      modular development philosophy reflects that.


      (This site is actually a great example of modular software... [more on
      that here](/posts/site-retrospective).)


      I'm a creative tinkerer with a broad range of development experience in
      various domains. I view programming as an extension of my creative
      toolkit, and seek to create beauty through code.


      I'm an authentic communicator. I believe in plain speaking, diplomacy, and
      honesty, whether leading a client meeting or a cross-functional work
      session. I have found a niche in liasing between the technical vernacular
      of developers, the

      scientific language of content writers, and the business vocabulary of
      clients.


      My skillset extends far beyond the domain of software and into the realm
      of video and music production, theatre and film, and visual art. I love to
      integrate these skills into my work wherever I can find the opportunity.

      ## I really do love code.


      I have been programming for about 15 years now. My first programming
      language was Actionscript 2 for Macromedia Flash. I made some silly little
      web games with it, and from then on I knew that programming was always
      going to be a part of my life. I went on to learn web development in high
      school, and was the only one in my class who "hand-wrote" my website while
      everyone else used Dreamweaver â€” I consequently then fixed everyone's
      Dreamweaver sites as the auto-generated DOMs were horrendous back
      then.&#x20;


      I went on to attend Queen's University for 8 years to learn everything I
      could about game development. In the process, I earned myself an Bachelor
      of Computer Science (with a specialization in software/game design) as
      well as a Master's of Science (with a focus on exergaming). Since
      graduation I have tried to learn as much as I can about development of all
      kinds. Most recently I have been investing a ton of energy into web
      development using modern JS frameworks and tooling (which incidentally led
      to the site you're looking at now).

      There are few joys in the world like the coalescence of skill and
      challenge. This is known as the flow state. I spent a lot of time in my
      education learning about the flow state and its applications in game
      design. Ironically though, the act of programming itself induces flow for
      me like almost nothing else. With every project my skillset expands and I
      put it to use almost immediately, forever increasing the challenge along
      with my ability.


      I also adore programming not just for its technical challenges, but for
      its applications in art and media. Whether it be art, music, or video
      creation, everything seems to be improved with technology. With that in
      mind, here are some samples from my portfolio. All three of these projects
      are built using the Unity game engine. For each project, I have created a
      post outlining my role(s) on the project, the intended outcomes of my
      work, and some features that I am particularly proud of.
